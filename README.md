# Dice Game that Infinitely Rolls Until the Rolled Number is not the Number of Sides

This repository is a dice game using Jupyter Notebooks from iPython that rolls infinitely until the rolled number is not the number of sides of the dice. It uses `ipywidgets` to use widgets for sliders to change the number of sides of dice and a button to roll dice.
